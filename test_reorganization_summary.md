# Test Reorganization Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Created a Dedicated Test Directory**
   - Created a `tests/` directory to house all test files
   - Moved all test files from the root directory to `tests/`
   - Maintained the organization of tests based on their function

2. **Updated Import Paths**
   - Adjusted system paths in test files to ensure proper imports
   - Replaced hardcoded paths with relative imports based on file location
   - Ensured tests can be run from either the project root or tests directory

3. **Created Test Runner**
   - Implemented a comprehensive test runner script (`run_tests.py`) in the tests directory
   - Added support for running individual tests or all tests at once
   - Included options for verbose output and selective test running

4. **Added Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with information about the test organization
   - Added a section on how to run tests
   - Created a root-level run_tests.py that explains the test structure

5. **Verified Test Functionality**
   - Ran tests to confirm they work correctly from the new location
   - Ensured imports and file access work properly from the tests directory
   - Confirmed no test files were left in the root directory

## Test Organization

The tests are now organized as follows:

```
/workspaces/agent-playground/
├── README.md                   # Updated with test information
├── run_tests.py                # Entry point with test explanation
└── tests/
    ├── basic_test.py           # Basic test for summarization agent
    ├── run_tests.py            # Test runner script
    ├── test_agent.py           # ID verification agent tests
    ├── test_agents.py          # Multiple agent tests
    ├── test_components.py      # Component testing
    ├── test_direct.py          # Direct test of summarization & reporting
    ├── test_end_to_end.py      # Full workflow tests
    ├── test_human_review.py    # Human review agent tests
    └── test_simplified_workflow.py   # Simplified workflow tests
```

## Redundant Files

No redundant test files were identified. All test files have been moved to the tests directory and serve specific testing purposes.

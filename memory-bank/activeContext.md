# Active Context: Source of Wealth Multi-Agent System

## Current Work Focus

The Source of Wealth Multi-Agent System has successfully implemented a complete CLI-based workflow for verifying and assessing client source of wealth information. The system now features a production-ready `sow-agent` command-line interface integrated with the agent playground framework, using LangGraph for orchestration and employing both local (Ollama) and cloud (OpenRouter) models for different aspects of the verification process.

### Key Areas of Development

1. **✅ COMPLETED**: CLI Implementation and Integration
2. **Agent Implementation**: Individual specialized agents for different verification tasks

- Evaluating parallel processing options for independent verification tasks

### 4. Security and Privacy
- Ensuring sensitive client data remains local
- Implementing proper authentication for human reviewers
- Considering encryption for stored verification results
- Enhancing audit logging for compliance purposes

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### 1. Agent Implementation Pattern
```python
async def agent_name(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # Process the state
    # ...
    
    # Update the state with results
    # Using minimal state updates for better performance with LangGraph
    state_update = {"result_key": result}
    
    # Log the action
    return log_action(state_update, "Agent_Name", "Action description", result)
```

### 2. Workflow Definition Pattern
```python
# Create workflow
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("node_name", agent_function)

# Add edges
workflow.add_edge("source_node", "target_node")

# Add conditional edges with dynamic routing
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "source_node",
    routing_function,
    {
        "condition1": "target_node1",
        "condition2": "target_node2",
        # Additional routing options
    }
)

# Compile workflow
graph = workflow.compile()

# Execute asynchronously
result = await graph.ainvoke(initial_state)
```

### 3. State Management Pattern
- Using TypedDict with Annotated types for state definition
- Using minimal state updates instead of copying the entire state
- Using explicit logging for all state changes
- Leveraging LangGraph's operator.add for list fields that can be appended to by multiple agents

## Learnings and Project Insights

### 1. LangGraph Integration
- LangGraph provides a powerful framework for agent orchestration
- State-based workflow simplifies agent interactions
- Visualization capabilities are valuable for debugging

### 2. Model Performance
- Local models are sufficient for basic document analysis
- Cloud models provide better performance for complex tasks
- Balancing between local and cloud models is important for privacy and performance

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Design
- Human oversight is essential for critical verification steps
- Clear presentation of verification results improves human decision-making
- Balancing automation and human judgment is key to effective verification

### 4. Testing Approach
- Mock agents are effective for testing workflow logic
- End-to-end tests with realistic data are important for validation
- Separating workflow testing from model testing improves efficiency

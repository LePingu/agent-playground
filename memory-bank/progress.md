## Current Status

### Overall Progress
- **Core Functionality**: 90% complete
- **Enhanced Features**: 50% complete
- **Testing**: 50% complete
- **Documentation**: 40% complete

### Recent Milestones
1. Implemented asynchronous execution throughout the workflow
2. Created dynamic verification planning with risk assessment
3. Enhanced state management with Annotated types
4. Implemented sequential enforcement for critical verification steps
5. Improved ID verification with better document analysis

### Current Sprint Focus
1. Enhancing web references agent with better source credibility assessment
2. Implementing proper logging and monitoring
3. Creating more comprehensive documentation
4. Implementing additional tests for validation

## Known Issues

### 1. Technical Issues
- **Web References**: Occasional timeouts when searching multiple sources
- **Performance**: Async execution helps but still slow with local models for complex documents
- **Error Handling**: Some edge cases not properly handled
- **State Management**: Potential race conditions with concurrent state updates

### 2. Integration Issues
- **Environment Setup**: Manual configuration of Ollama required
- **API Keys**: Need to be manually added to environment variables
- **Model Availability**: Depends on external services (OpenRouter)
- **Async Compatibility**: Some libraries may not be fully async-compatible

### 3. Usability Issues
- **Human Review Interface**: Command-line interface is not user-friendly
- **Error Messages**: Improved but still not always clear or actionable
- **Documentation**: Incomplete for some components
- **Verification Planning**: Complex verification plans may be difficult to understand

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### 1. Architecture Decisions
- **Initial Approach**: Monolithic script with all verification logic
- **Intermediate Approach**: Modular agent-based architecture with LangGraph orchestration
- **Current Approach**: Dynamic verification planning with risk assessment-driven workflow
- **Rationale**: More flexible workflow, better adaptability to different client scenarios

### 2. Model Selection
- **Initial Approach**: Use a single model provider for all tasks
- **Current Approach**: Dual-model approach with local models for sensitive data
- **Rationale**: Better privacy protection while maintaining performance for non-sensitive tasks
- **Future Consideration**: Evaluating performance tradeoffs between local and cloud models

### 3. Human Oversight
- **Initial Approach**: Fully automated verification
- **Intermediate Approach**: Human-in-the-loop for critical verification steps
- **Current Approach**: Dynamic routing to human review based on verification issues
- **Rationale**: More efficient use of human reviewers, focusing on problematic verifications

### 4. State Management
- **Initial Approach**: Full state copying for each agent
- **Current Approach**: Minimal state updates with Annotated types
- **Rationale**: Better performance, reduced memory usage, and clearer state transitions
